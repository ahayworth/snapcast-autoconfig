# We only explicitly manage the streams and clients referenced in this file - however,
# that doesn't mean that snapcast-autoconfig won't inadvertently mess up a manual grouping
# you've made. Snapcast groups are dynamic, fuzzy things. YMMV.
#
# For each stream, the clients that should be grouped together when it starts playing are listed.
# The order of the streams is important - streams higher up take precedence over streams further
# down when deciding which group should claim clients. For example, consider a scenario where
# the 'office' and 'wholehouse' streams are playing simultaneously. In that case, the 'office' client
# would always be grouped with the 'office' stream as configured here, because it has the highest priority
# in the list. The 'wholehouse' stream wouldn't get the 'office' client; it'd technically be incomplete.

    # Here we've configured the 'kitchen' client to have its volume lowered to 70

    # listed; and will always overwrite any manual configuration you've done in the UI.
